# jParallax.js

jParallax is just a simple parallax effect maker. No complicated **WTFs!!**, just
simply controlling your container's background image's position on scroll.

## Installation
Download the jParallax package and include it after jQuery.
```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="jParallax.js path here"></script>
```

## Usage
### Step 1: Adding a class to your container element.
jParallax is very simple to use. Simply add a class `jparallax` to your element.

Example:
```
<div class="jparallax">
    <!--Some Contents Here-->
</div>
```
### Step 2: Use data attributes to assign the Background Image.
Use `data-image` attribute to assign a background image.

Example: *(Using the previous code...)*
```
<div class="jparallax" data-image="path/to/backgroundimagefile.jpg">
    <!--Some Contents Here-->
</div>
```

You're done! Just simple as that.

**NOTE**: Background Image is required. Also, by default, the container's `height` is
set to `auto`. So if the parallax effect is not showing, maybe put some contents inside
it and another container below to see the effect.

## Options
You can pass options by using the data attributes.

Examples:

To set the container's height, use `data-height="500px"`.

To set the container's background image speed on scroll, use `data-speed=6`.

Currently available options:

| Attribute | Type | Default | Reuired |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| *data-image* | Path | null | **Yes** |
| *data-height* | number | auto | No |
| *data-speed* | float | 8 | No |

**NOTE:** When `speed` is set to 0, the background will become fixed. If 1, It will just scroll with the same speed.
